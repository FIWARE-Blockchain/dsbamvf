market -> market :Create Authenticaton Request
siop<--market--++ :URI + <Authentication Request>

siop -> DIDR--++: Resolve DID of\nMarketplace
note over DIDR
    This is a Universal Resolver blockchain node, and there may be as many as needed
    Its mission is to resolve DIDs using the blockchain and return the associated DID Document
    The DID Document (as per W3C) contains relevant information about the entity owner of the DID
    It contains its Public Key, used to verify the digital signature of the entity
    It also contains the status of the entity in the Data Space ecosystem
    It is extensible, and can contain any public information which may be relevant for the use case
    The Universal Resolver server has to be operated by a trusted entity for the customer
    There may be as many nodes as needed operated by different entities
    At least one of those trusted entities has to be configured in the wallet of the user
end note 
siop<--DIDR--++: DID Document of\Marketplace
siop -> siop: Verify Authentication Request
note right siop
    The wallet checks the digital signature of the Authentication Request
    Checks that the DID inside the request matches the DID inside the DID Document from Universal Resolver
    It also checks additional info inside the request against the DID Document
    Now the wallet knows that Marketplace is a trusted entity and that it signed the request
end note

siop -> siop: Create Authentication Response\nURI + <id_token>
note right siop
    The wallet creates a SIOP Authentication Response
    It includes a Verifiable Credential as an additional claim
    The Verifiable Credential was issued by Packet Delivery Co as an employee badge
end note
siop -> market--++ #DarkSeaGreen: POST <id_token>\n/siop-sessions

market->DIDR--++: Resolve DID of\nPacket Delivery Co
note over DIDR
    This can be a blockchain node of Packet Delivery Co or of any entity trusted by it
    For maximum level of trust, the node is operated by Marketplace
    The Verifiable Credential received from the user was signed by Packet Delivery Co and includes its DID
    Marketplace retrieves from blockchain the DID Document for that DID
    Checks the digital signature and other info (eg., status in Data Space)
end note
market<--DIDR--++ #DarkSeaGreen: DID Document with public key
market->market: Verify Authentication Response
note over market
    The VC issued by Packet Delivery Co to its employee includes the Public Key of the SIOP used to sign
    The Public Key of the SIOP was verified when the employee was onboarded by Happy Pets
end note
